Create a Game class that initializes with a random code
consisting of four colors from a set of six possible colors.

Define a method get_guess that allows the user to input their guess of the secret code.

Create a method provide_feedback that compares the user's guess
to the secret code and provides feedback on how good the guess was.

Set up a loop within the Game class that allows the user 12 turns to guess the secret code.

If the user doesn't guess the code within 12 turns,
the game is over and they lose. If the user does guess the code, the game is over and they win.

Create a Player class that allows the user to choose whether
they want to be the creator of the secret code or the guesser.

If the user chooses to create the secret code, prompt them to enter their code.

If the user chooses to guess the code, modify the Game class
to have the computer guess randomly at first, and then use the feedback
from previous guesses to improve its next guess.

Implement a strategy for the computer that follows the rules of the game
or modify the rules by providing additional information to the computer about each guess.

Test the game thoroughly to ensure it functions as expected.
