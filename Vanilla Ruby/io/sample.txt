Skim Alan Skorkin’s post about serialization.
Some of the code examples are outdated, but this post still contains relevant information.
If you want to follow along with the code examples, copy and paste them into your code editor and use word wrap.
Read the Chapter on File I/O of the Bastard’s Book of Ruby.
Note: the ruby gem “open-URI” referenced in this assignment has been updated since publishing this material.
Calling open(filename) is deprecated as of Ruby 3.0+. The updated usage is now to call
URI.open(filename) directly.
