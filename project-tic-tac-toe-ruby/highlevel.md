Define a Board class that represents the Tic Tac Toe board. 
This class should have a 2D array to store the state of the board, 
and methods to display the board, update the board with a player's move, 
and check if the game has been won or tied.

Define a Player class that represents a player in the game. 
This class should have a name and a marker (e.g. "X" or "O").

Define a Game class that represents the Tic Tac Toe game. 
This class should have two instances of the Player class, an instance of the Board class, 
and a current player (i.e. the player whose turn it is).

Implement a loop in the Game class that runs until the game is won or tied. 
In each iteration of the loop, display the current state of the board, 
prompt the current player to enter their move, update the board with the player's move, 
and check if the game has been won or tied. If the game has been won or tied, exit the loop.

Once the game is over, display the final state of the board and the result of the game 
(i.e. which player won or if it was a tie).
